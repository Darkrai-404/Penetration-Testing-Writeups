# Penetration-Testing-Writeups
The repository consists of various penetration testing writeups on vulnerable machines and popular CVEs with topics ranging from bug bounties, buffer overflows, CTFs, vulnhub machines, hardware challenges and real life encounters.. The labs and projects in this repo is helpful for people practicing their techniques for OSCP. I will periodically update the repository once I reformat my PDFs into Markdown.

##  1. <a name='Jangow01'></a>Jangow 01
Jangow01 is a vulnerable machine centered around enumeration. It focuses on poorly configured webpages leading to data leakage.

##  2. <a name='CVE-2014-627Shellshock'></a>CVE-2014-627 Shellshock

Shellshock is a vulnerability that allows systems containing a vulnerable version of Bash to be exploited to execute commands with higher privileges. This allows attackers to potentially take over that system. In the demo, we will learn how to detect and exploit such vulnerabilities in a given target.
