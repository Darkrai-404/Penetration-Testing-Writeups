##  1. <a name='Jangow01'></a>Jangow 01
Jangow01 is a vulnerable machine designed to help students in preparing for certifications such as OSCP, ejpt as well as practicing various penetration testing methodologies.

##  2. <a name='CVE-2014-627Shellshock'></a>CVE-2014-627 Shellshock

Shellshock is a vulnerability that allows systems containing a vulnerable version of Bash to be exploited to execute commands with higher privileges. This allows attackers to potentially take over that system. In the demo, we will learn how to detect and exploit such vulnerabilities in a given target.
